# empoar-platform-monorepo

EMPOAR Platform - A crowd investment platform enabling investments in real estate and solar projects across East Africa

<!-- Use cases: A description of the project and a list of use cases already implemented. If some use cases have not been implemented yet, please state that next to them.
A README.md file with instructions for how to set up a development environment for your project. Most importantly, include how to set up or connect to your database.
An entity-relationship model (ER model) of your database needs to be included in your documentation. The model should be clear and readable. The model should show the details of the relationships (cardinality, keys and indexes, etc).
Your database model should not be trivial. Trivial implementation does not help you grasp the module's learning objectives well. Therefore, it should encompass multiple entities, including at least one many-to-many relationship.
Data: Mention how much data you have and, if generated, how it was generated.
Use the hand-in form on the Learning Platform to submit artifacts. -->

<!-- Documentation of your project and code documentation (for instance, a well-written README.md file inside your code repository) as well as instructions for how to set up a development environment for your project (if not already included with the repository itself).
A threat model description for your system needs to be included in your documentation.
A list of cyber security measures that you have implemented needs to be included in your documentation. -->
